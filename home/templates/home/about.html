            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <p> Firstly, Welcome to Tasty Tipples. <br> We are a group of friends who set up Tasty Tipples back in the great lock down of 2021.
                When the pubs closed and the off licences were jammed, we said Hey.... lets sell direct to the customer via an online drink shop, and so it all began.</p>

            <p>We are passionate about everything artisanal, including beer, whiskey, tequila, wine, and gin. Do we really need to say more?
                Our aim is to bring unique, creative drinks right to your home. 
                The drinks industry is always evolving, and our committed team is constantly looking for the newest trends,
                enticing beverages, and ingredients to create any cocktail imaginable.</p>
