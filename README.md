# <img src="assets/readme/agile_icon.png" alt="agile" width="45"/> Agile Approach to Project Devlopment 

An agile approach was taken in the development of this project. The project was dissected into smaller parts and an iterative approach to project management and development will be used to achieve faster development of the project and optimise time usage.

- MoSoCoW Method:
  - I will also aim to integrate the MoSoCoW Method in to this project. Which is a four-step approach to prioritizing which project requirements need to be carried out first in order to achieve project goals and criteria of user stories. Custom labels will be created in GitHub and allocated to each requirement so they can be easily filtered and identified.
  - <img src="assets/readme/moscow .png" alt="MoSoCoW Method" width="350"/>
- User Stories
  - The whole project was broken down in 30 individual user stories, each user story was a self-contained development mini project that helped reach the overall goal of the website. They were entered into GitHub as GitHub issues.
  - [View List of 30 User Stories](https://github.com/wlillisdev/tasty_tipples/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
  - Specific acceptance criteria was allocated for each user story and a list of tasks were also established. Each task would need to be completed to ensure acceptance criteria is met. See example below.
  - ![Issue Example](assets/readme/issue_example.png)
  - The Moscow method was then applied to each user story. And tags were applied to prioritise the order of work.
  - [Example of MOSCOW tags](assets/readme/moscow_tags.png)
  - The user’s stories were then put into Tasty Tipples Iteration 1 for website launch. These users stories were deemed essential for the initial launch of the website.
  - [View Project Iterations](https://github.com/wlillisdev/tasty_tipples/milestones)
  - A Kanban board was set up in GitHub in order to manage the various project user stories. It was divided into 3 main areas to track the progress of user stories. The 3 Columns were To Do, In Progress and Done.

 - Theme
   - The Theme of the website was to build a bright and engaging ecommerce site. The styling was kept to the minimum as we didn’t want to take away from the product images. And wanted the customer to focus 100% on the products.
   - Fonts were imported from google fonts, Pacifico for the logo & Lato were chosen for general text.

 - Data Model
   - Lucid Charts was used to design and visualise the models used in this project.

    - <img src="assets/readme/database_erd.png" alt="erd diagram" width="750"/>
    - Green refers to custom models

 - Colour Palette
   - The colour palette is made up of Three main colours. Although simple they create a good contrast with each other and helps support the overall theme. The Blue was used mainly for buttons and the green for a hover effect on buttons.

 ![Colour Palette](assets/readme/color_pallet.png)


- Imagery
   - The images that were selected for the website were bold and bright and conveyed fun and enjoyment. products were kept with white background where possible to highlight them more.

- Wireframes
  - To create the initial layout and wireframe I used Balsamiq. This helped fine tune the design and layout. It also helped in calculating the amount of content and images required.

## Target Audience
 Tasty Tipples is a Business to Customer business model. Our Target market currently is male and female aged between 25 to 50 located in Ireland. Once the shop is established, we will be aiming our sights on high value clients on the world market with our high-end spirits made in Ireland


## Marketing Mix
  We have decided to adopt a multi prong approach to launch Tasty Tipples. A mixture of paid and organic methods will be adopted to get quick and consistent traffic and sales to the new website. The staff are already proficient in all elements of social media. They will manage this internally; they will leverage content creation and short form video content to gain brand awareness and drive traffic to the site. Due to lack of knowledge and time some services will be outsourced such as paid marketing, email marketing and SEO. With this multi-channel approach, it will drive short-, medium- and long-term growth for Tasty Tipples.


## Social Media
- Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok
  - Our social channels are how we aim to build our brand awareness and drive organic traffic initially to our website.
  - We will aim to create short snappy fun video content and leverage the growing trends of TikTok, YouTube Shorts & reels to grown our followers and drive traffic quickly. With the aim of getting our content viral.

## SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)
- Keyword Research
  - A number of tools were used to compile a list of keywords and analyse keywords to see the search volume, difficulty & buyers intent.
  - [Googles Keyword planner](assets/readme/google_planner_ireland.png)
  - [Wordtracker.com](assets/readme/whiskey_keywords.png)
  - [And the related searches section at the bottom of a google search page](assets/readme/related_searches.png)
  - A list of keywords was selected to represent the buyer’s journey. A mixture of long tail and short tail Keywords with low to high keyword competitiveness were picked.
  - ![keyword funnel](assets/readme/keyword-funnel-stages.jpg)
  - Onsite SEO will be carried out to optimise product pages & alt tags. Due to time constraints, it will not be completed in this iteration of the project.
  - Long-term off-site SEO link building campaigns will also be used to grow organic search traffic. This will be completed in future iterations of the project.


## Content Marketing

- The Tipple Blog
  - Our blog will be used to target SEO keywords and answer questions that people are actively searching for answers to online. This will not only educate our shoppers but it also helps build confidence and trust in our brand. While at the same time ranking the website in search results for more keywords.

- Short Form Content 
  - With a huge shift on all social channels to short form video content we still actively release short videos on a daily basis to leverage this trend. Software like [repurpose.io](https://repurpose.io/) will be used to post content across all channels at the same time to improve productivity and get maximum exposure.



## Paid
- As this is a brand-new website it will take time to generate organic traffic from search engines. For the first 6 months we will actively be using and testing paid ads to drive traffic and conversions.
- Google PPC
  - We will actively run google ads especially targeting our high-ticket products.
- Facebook, TikTok, YouTube
  - We will run ad campaigns on these channels mainly focused on brand awareness and building an online presence. We won’t directly market drink products on these channels. But adopt a playful and fun approach to engage with users.


## Email Marketing
- Email marketing when done correctly has low input costs and allows us to target our customers with a more customised offering giving a Better ROI.
- Mail Chimp
  - We will initially build a subscriber list to our newsletter via the form in the footer of our website.
  - We will also send weekly newsletters about our latest’s drinks deals, secret sales and new products releases.


## Outsourcing
- The intention is to outsource all paid marketing to a digital agency & also get them to monitor and update our keywords for SEO & build backlinks on a periodic basis. The agency will also take care of the email marketing campaigns. The rest will be done in-house by the staff of Tasty Tipples.


## Sitemap.xml
- A sitemap file with a list of all the important URLs were created to allow search engines to quickly crawl the website and index its pages. This was made using [XML-sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) This can then be submitted to google search console and Bing webmaster tools to allow the quick and fast indexing of Tasty Tipples in search engines.


## Robots.txt

# <img src="assets/readme/bugs_icon.png" alt="bugs" width="45"/>  Fixed Bugs

  - When testing the shopping bag, I noticed that the user could type in any quantity and form validation was not working. Further investigation I noticed that the update and remove options were just links and they were outside the form tags. I changed the update link to a button with "submit" and put it inside the form tags. Form validation is now working and the user can only enter a number between 1 & 99.
  [Bug in Bag View Quantity](assets/readme/form_bug.png)  
  - After running the site through HTML checker, a number of small bugs were identified. Each error was identified and an appropriate solution applied, I went through all pages and fixed any errors. It was good lesson and practice in finding problems with code and fixing them.
  - After Running all the pages through lighthouse, it identified issues with a number of images due to size. Lighthouse suggested to change some larger images which was done.
  - After running all python code through the terminal console using the command python3 -m flake8 a number of errors were identified and fixed. 
  - When using crispy forms on product detail page for the review form it would not appear, I did a lot of research and discussed with tutor support, no easy fix was found, so I came up with a work around and manually coded the form. It worked out better in the end as I was able to apply better styling and formatting manually.
  - When deploying the site. AWS was displaying images on the site, but when I uploaded a picture, it crashed the site. After much troubleshooting I discovered there was white space in AWS keys in the Heroku config variables. When this was deleted, it worked fine.
  - After deploying the site i noticed the confirmation emails were not sending and the webhooks were failing, I updated the webhook.url to the deployed site URL and it worked fine.
  - During development in gitpod, the stripe webhooks were working ok, but they started failing 2 weeks after initially being setup, after much head scratching, I noticed that my URL in gitpod had changed for some reason and no longer matched what was initially setup in stripe. Once updated in stripe it worked ok.

            ],
            "Resource": [

                "YOUR-ARN-NO-HERE/*"
            ]
        }
    ]

```

1. Ensure the policy has been given a name and a brief description, then click "Create Policy".
2. Click "User groups", and then the group you created previously. Under permissions click "Add Permission" then click "Attach Policies".
3. Select "Users" from the sidebar and click "Add User".
4. Provide a username and check "Programmatic Access", then click 'Next: Permissions'.
5. Ensure your policy is selected and navigate through until you click "Add User".
6. Download the "CSV file", which contains the user's access key and secret access key.


## Connecting AWS to Django

Now that you have created a S3 bucket with its user group attached, we need to connect it to Django.

1. First you we will install two packages. Boto3 and Django storages.  
    ```
    pip3 install boto3
    pip3 install Django-storages
    ```
    And remember to freeze the requirements with:  
    ```
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
2. You will then need to add 'storages' to your installed apps section inside your settings.py file. Do that now. 
3. Next, we will need to add some additional settings to the same file to let Django know what bucket it's communicating with. 
4. Somewhere near the bottom of the file you should write an if statement to check if there is an environment variable called USE_AWS. This variable does not exist yet but we will add it later. Inside the if statement, write the following settings so it looks like this:  
    ```
    if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
        AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-your-bucket-name-here'
        AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    ```
5. Next, back in Heroku and in the settings tab, under config vars, you will need to add  keys with values that were downloaded earlier in the CSV file.
6. Add the key, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID with the value that was generated in the CSV file earlier. Then add the key AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and again add the value that was generated in the CSV file. Once they have both been added, add the key USE_AWS, and set the value to True.
7. You can now also remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTAIC variable, since Django should now collect static files automatically and upload them to S3.
8. Now head back to the settings.py file in your Django project and head back to the if statement we wrote earlier and inside the statement add this line setting:  
    ```
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
    ```
    This is to tell Django where our static files will be coming from in production.
9. Next we need to create a file to tell Django that we want to use S3 to store our static files whenever someone runs collect static and also that we want any uploaded product images to go there also.
10. In the root directory of your project create a file called 'custom_storages.py'. Inside this file you will need to import your settings as well as the s3boto3 storage class. So, at the top of the file insert the code:  
    ```
    from django.conf import settings
    from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage
    ```
11. Then underneath the imports insert these two classes:  
    ```
    class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

    class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
    ```
    The STATICFILES_LOCATION and MEDIAFILES_LOCATION have yet to be defined, so lets do that now.
12. Back in the settings.py file, underneath the bucket config settings but still inside the if statement, add these lines:  
    ```
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
    ```
13. Next, you will also need to override and explicitly set the URLs for static and media files using your custom domain and new locations. To do this add these two lines inside the same if statement:  
    ```
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
    ```
14. If you now save, add, commit and push your changes, you should see that your S3 bucket now has a static folder with all your static files inside. Next, we need to handle the Media files but first, inside the if statement add the following code. This helps to speed things up by letting the browser know that its ok to cache static files for a long time:    
    ```
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }
    ```
15. Back in S3, go to your bucket and click 'Create folder'. Name the folder 'media' and click 'Save'. 
16. Inside the media folder you just created, click 'Upload', 'Add files', and then select all the images that you are using on your site.
17. Then under 'Permissions' select the option 'Grant public-read access' and click upload.  
18. Once that is completed, you're ready. All your static files and media files should be linked from Django to your S3 bucket.

## Payments

1. To set up stripe payments you can use this guide [here](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment#web-collect-card-details).



## Webhooks

1. To set up a webhook, sign into your stripe account and click 'Developers' located in the top right of the navbar.
2. Then in the side-nav under the Developers title, click on 'Webhooks', then 'Add endpoint'.
3. On the next page you will need to input the link to your Heroku app followed by /checkout/wh/. It should look something like this:  
4. Then click '+ Select events' and check the 'Select all events' checkbox at the top before clicking 'Add events' at the bottom. Once this is done finish the form by clicking 'Add endpoint'.
5. Your webhook is now created and you should see that it has generated a secret key. You will need this to add to your Heroku config vars.
6. Head over to your app in Heroku and navigate to the config vars section under settings. You will need the secret key you just generated for your webhook, in addition to your Publishable key and secret key that you can find in the API keys section back in stripe.
7. Add these values under these keys:  
    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'insert your stripe publishable key'
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'insert your secret key'
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = 'insert your webhooks secret key'
    ```
8. Finally, back in your setting.py file in Django, insert the following near the bottom of the file:  
    ```
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')
